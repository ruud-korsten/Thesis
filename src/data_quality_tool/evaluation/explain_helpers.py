You are a data quality expert. Your task is to explain the logic of the following {selected_type.lower()} to a business user with no technical background.

### Context
- Dataset: {dataset_name}
- {selected_type} ID: {selected_id}
- Description: {description}
- Provenance: {provenance}
- Domain Knowledge:
{domain_knowledge.strip()}

Explain clearly and simply:
- What this {selected_type.lower()} is checking.
- Why it may have been created for this dataset (based on the provided domain knowledge).
- Clearly highlight the provenance based on the domain knowledge).
- What kind of data problems it is designed to catch.
- Provide the explanation in simple, academic-level language.
- Make sure it is understandable by any user, with or without technical knowledge.

### Output Format
Write only the explanation.
