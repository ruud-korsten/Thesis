   - Extreme outliers beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean should be flagged.  

7. **airflow_cfm**: Numerical measurement of airflow in cubic feet per minute. Data type: numerical.  
   - Must be a non-negative value (e.g., greater than or equal to 0).  
   - Should not be equal to known problematic values such as `error_value`.  
   - Extreme outliers beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean should be flagged.  

8. **fan_speed_pct**: Numerical measurement of fan speed percentage. Data type: numerical.  
   - Must be within a valid range (e.g., 0 to 100 percent).  
   - Should not be equal to known problematic values such as `error_value`.  
   - Extreme outliers beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean should be flagged.  

9. **filter_status**: Categorical status of the filter, indicating whether it is clean, dirty, or needs change. Data type: categorical.  
   - Must not contain null or empty values.  
   - Should follow predefined categories (e.g., {clean, dirty, needs_change}).  
   - Should not contain known problematic values such as `error_value`.
